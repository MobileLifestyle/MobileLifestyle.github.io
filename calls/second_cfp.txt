---------------------| IMPORTANT DATES FOR THE WORKSHOP |----------------------
* Submission deadline: August 6th, 2020
* Notification of acceptance: August, 2020
* Camera ready version due: September, 2020
* Workshop date: Early October, 2020


----------| OBJECTIVES: Inclusive Communication between AVs and VRUs |---------
Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to become a part of the road traffic in
the near future. This upcoming change raises concerns on how human vulnerable
road users (VRUs), e.g., cyclists or pedestrians, would interact with them to
ensure safe communication on the road. Previous work focused primarily on the
scenario in which a young adult without impairments crosses a street in front
of an automated vehicle. Several road user groups, such as children, seniors,
or people with special needs, in roles of pedestrians and cyclists, are not
considered in this scenario. On top of this, cultural differences are rarely
considered. To ensure that future traffic is safe and accessible for all
citizens, we aim to address inclusive communication between automated
vehicles and vulnerable road users. In this workshop, we will discuss and
exchange methods, tools, and scenarios applicable for inclusive
communication, identify the most relevant research gaps, and connect people
for future collaborations.


------------------------------| WORKSHOP THEMES |------------------------------
Potential topics to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited
to:
* Overview on current state and research gaps in research on
  interactions between AVs and VRUs
* Communication concepts for underrepresented user groups, such as
  - Children
  - People with impaired vision
  - Older adults
* Guidelines for inclusive design from related domains, such as
  - Mobile Human-Computer Interaction
  - Human-Robot Interaction


-------------------------------| PARTICIPATION |-------------------------------
This workshop welcomes researchers and practitioners with interest in
accessible technology, interactive technologies for children, seniors, or
people with impairments, or automotive user interfaces. Specifically, we want
to reach those developing mobile interfaces for traffic participants (e.g.,
pedestrians, or cyclists), inclusive interfaces (addressing, e.g., visually
impaired people), or external human-machine interfaces for AVs. This workshop
aims at providing an overview of the current state of the research for
interaction between AVs and VRUs. We want to identify the research gap and
raise awareness for lowering the barriers to traffic participation. The
participants can expect experience and live feedback in designing inclusive
interfaces. Further, we plan to establish communication with workshop
attendees for future (international) collaborations.
Participants are invited to submit papers or videos to the workshop. The
review process will be conducted by a program committee consisting of the
organizers. Registration for the workshop is mandatory for all workshop
participants and will be EUR 30 (or EUR 20 for early registrations).


--------------------------------| SUBMISSIONS |--------------------------------
Participants are invited to submit a three-minute video or a position paper of
two to four pages, not counting references, via EasyChair by August 6th 2020.
All submissions must follow the new ACM Conference Proceedings "Master" 
Template: https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow/.
Submissions are not anonymous but reviews will be done anonymously
(single-blind). Each paper will receive at least two reviews. All accepted
papers will be published online before the beginning of the workshop.
