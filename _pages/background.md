To be understandable and acceptable by other road users, automated vehicles (AVs) might need to communicate in a
special way [[12]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref12), [15]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref15)]. This workshop will focus on the communication between AVs and vulnerable road users (VRUs),
especially those who benefit most from inclusive design, like children, older adults or people with disabilities and
reduced mobility, cognition, vision, or orientation. This part of the population is largely underrepresented in AV-VRU
research [[6]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref6), [10]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref10)].

Previous works on the interaction between VRUs and AVs through external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs, see
Figure 1) [[6]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref6), [10]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref10), [15]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref15), [19]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref19)] or by simulating social interactions via eye contact or gestures [[33]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref33)] focus primarily on visual
stimuli (e.g., [[14]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref14), [28]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref28)]), and do not comply with the principles of Universal Design [[7]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref7)], as they exclude people with
visual, cognitive, or motor impairments [[6]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref6)]. Our previous workshops focused on exploring eHMI designs [[26]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref26)], methods
to evaluate them [[9]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref9), [27]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref27)], and also started the discussion on inclusive eHMIs [[13]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref13), [18]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref18)]. Building on these workshops,
our goal is to continue the discussion on inclusive solutions for the AV-VRU interaction, specifically focusing on the international perspective and identifying the obstacles to consolidating the vast amount of eHMI concepts into a few
inclusive ones.

Of particular interest in this workshop are children, older adults, and people with accessibility needs. Children
between the ages of six and thirteen are the most vulnerable subgroup among cyclists due to their still developing
motor and perceptual-motor skills [[1]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref1), [11]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref11), [22]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref22) – [25]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref25)], but are underrepresented in previous eHMI studies [[8]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref8)]. Research
also shows that older adults are underrepresented in studies. At the same time, they have difficulties with regard to
taking road-crossing decisions [[31]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref31)], and have different expectations for automated driving than younger adults [[20]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref20)],
take longer to adapt to new technology [[2]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref2)], and have different requirements [[17]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref17)]. Further, people with auditory/visual
impairments constitute a significant proportion of the VRU demographic [[3]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref3), [29]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref29), [30]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref30)], but are largely uncatered for,
especially given the predominance of visual eHMI concepts [[4]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref4) – [6]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref6), [21]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref21)].
