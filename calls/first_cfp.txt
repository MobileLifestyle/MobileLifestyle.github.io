----------| OBJECTIVES: Inclusive Communication between AVs and VRUs |---------
Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to become a part of the road traffic in 
the near future. This upcoming change raises concerns on how human vulnerable 
road users (VRUs), e.g., cyclists or pedestrians, would interact with them to 
ensure safe communication on the road. Previous work focused primarily on the 
scenario in which a young adult without impairments crosses a street in front 
of an automated vehicle. Several road user groups, such as children, seniors, 
or people with special needs, in roles of pedestrians and cyclists, are not 
considered in this scenario. On top of this, cultural differences are rarely 
considered. To ensure that future traffic is safe and accessible for all 
citizens, we aim to address inclusive communication between automated 
vehicles and vulnerable road users. In this workshop, we will discuss and 
exchange methods, tools, and scenarios applicable for inclusive 
communication, identify the most relevant research gaps, and connect people 
for future collaborations.


------------------------------| WORKSHOP THEMES |------------------------------
Potential topics to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited 
to: 
* Overview on current state and research gaps in research on 
  interactions between AVs and VRUs 
* Communication concepts for underrepresented user groups, such as
  - Children 
  - People with impaired vision
  - Older adults
* Guidelines for inclusive design from related domains, such as
  - Mobile Human-Computer Interaction
  - Human-Robot Interaction 


-------------------------------| PARTICIPATION |-------------------------------
This workshop welcomes researchers and practitioners with interest in 
accessible technology, interactive technologies for children, seniors, or 
people with impairments, or automotive user interfaces. Specifically, we want 
to reach those developing mobile interfaces for traffic participants (e.g., 
pedestrians, or cyclists), inclusive interfaces (addressing, e.g., visually 
impaired people), or external human-machine interfaces for AVs. This workshop 
aims at providing an overview of the current state of the research for 
interaction between AVs and VRUs. We want to identify the research gap and 
raise awareness for lowering the barriers to traffic participation. The 
participants can expect hands-on experience and live feedback in designing 
inclusive interfaces. Further, we plan to establish communication with 
workshop attendees for future (international) collaborations. Participants 
will be selected based on their submission through a review process. The 
review process will be conducted by a program committee consisting of the 
organizers. Registration for the main conference is mandatory for all 
workshop participants, but there are no additional costs for attending the 
workshop beyond the main conference registration fee.


--------------------------------| SUBMISSIONS |--------------------------------
Participants are expected to submit a position paper of two to four pages, 
not counting references, via e-mail to wecare2020@pm.me by July 2nd 2020. 
All submissions must follow the new CHI Extended Abstracts format: 
https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF 
Submissions are not anonymous but reviews will be done anonymously 
(single-blind). Each paper will receive at least two reviews. All accepted 
papers will be published online before the beginning of the workshop.
