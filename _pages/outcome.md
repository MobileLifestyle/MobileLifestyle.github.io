## Planned Outcomes
This workshop brings together people from different fields and backgrounds to discuss how to design and build
interactions for future AVs. The outcomes will help the researchers to define and explore the required dimensions and
approach better, potentially leading to novel design spaces (e.g., see [[2]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref2), [6]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref6)]), simulators (e.g., see [[1]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref1), [5]({{site.baseurl}}/References/#ref5)]), or design methods. To share the results with the community, accepted position papers will be published on the workshop website (if the
authors agree to do so).

## Accepted Position Papers
The accepted position papers will be published here and presented at the workshop.
