This workshop invites people from different cultures, backgrounds, and affiliations to explore the interplay of automated vehicles and other road users. 
The workshop emphasizes cultural differences, diversity, and inclusive design solutions for the interaction of AVs and VRUs. 
<!-- The organizers will be available throughout the sessions to support participants during the activities. An overview of the schedule is presented on the left sidebar.  -->
We welcome researchers and practitioners with interest in accessible technology, interactive technologies for children, seniors, or people with impairments, or automotive user interfaces. Specifically, we want to reach those developing mobile interfaces for traffic participants (e.g., pedestrians, or cyclists), inclusive interfaces (addressing, e.g., visually impaired people), or external human-machine interfaces for AVs. 
<!-- We will reach out to the community via social media channels (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn), mailing lists (e.g., GI, or ACM SIGCHI), and at the AutomotiveUI conference. We expect to have 15 to 20 attendees.  -->

## Paper Submission
Participants are required to submit position papers between two and four pages, not counting references, in the [2020 CHI Extended Abstract Format](https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF). 
The generated PDF should be submitted via [EasyChair (easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wecare2020)](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wecare2020). 

Submissions **need not be anonymous**. However, reviews will be done anonymously. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two organizers of this workshop with regard to its contribution to the workshop. **All accepted papers will be published online** before the beginning of the workshop. 

## Goals of the Workshop
We intend to achieve the following goals with this workshop:
1.	Provide an overview of the current state of the research for interaction between AVs and VRUs.
2.	Identify the research gap and raise awareness for lowering the barriers to traffic participation.
3.	Hands-on experience and live feedback in designing inclusive interfaces.
4.	Establish communication with workshop attendees for future (international) collaborations.

### Workshop Themes
Potential topics to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited to: 
* Overview of the current state and research gaps in research on interactions between AVs and VRUs 
* Communication concepts for underrepresented user groups, such as
  * Children 
  * People with impaired vision
  * Older adults
* Guidelines for inclusive design from related domains, such as
  * Mobile Human-Computer Interaction
  * Human-Robot Interaction
