We are happy to announce that our workshop offered in conjunction with the 22nd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services ([MobileHCI 2020](https://mobilehci.acm.org/2020/)) will still take place: 
*WeCARe - Workshop on Inclusive Communication between Automated Vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users*

Due to the measures against COVID-19, this workshop will be held remotely. We have updated the preliminary schedule, extended the deadlines, and now also allow video submissions. 

Participants are invited to submit a three-minute video or a two to four-page position paper (references not included) via EasyChair by August 6, 2020. 
All submissions must follow the new [ACM Conference Proceedings "Master" Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow/). 
Submissions are not anonymous, but the review will be anonymous (single-blind). 
Each submission will receive at least two reviews. All accepted contributions will be published online before the workshop starts. 
Registration for the workshop is obligatory for all workshop participants and costs 30 EUR (or 20 EUR for early registration).

We look forward to welcoming you.
