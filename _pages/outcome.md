## Planned Outcomes
The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together people from different areas to discuss how to develop inclusive communication concepts for automated vehicles that need to interact with human traffic participants. Accepted position papers will be published here. 

We will summarize the presented works, discussions, and results of the workshop into an article. 
As this topic is under-reported, we have the ambition to make a special issue, given there is enough interest from the workshop participants.
