<p> <span style="font-size: 1.5em">Workshop on Inclusive Communication between Automated Vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users </span><br/>

<!-- **Note:** Participants must submit a position paper before the workshop. See [Participate](/Participate) for more details.

{% include gallery caption="Communication concepts for automated vehicles exist (left). But, are they inclusive for all vulnerable road users, including, for example, blind people (center) or older adults (right)?" %}

Automated vehicles are expected to become a part of the road traffic in the near future. This upcoming change raises concerns on how human road users, e.g., cyclists or pedestrians, would interact with them to ensure safe communication on the road. 
Previous work focused primarily on the scenario in which a young adult without impairments crosses a street in front of an automated vehicle. Several road user groups, such as children, seniors, or people with special needs, in roles of pedestrians and cyclists, are not considered in this scenario. On top of this, cultural differences are rarely considered. 

To ensure that future traffic is safe and accessible for all citizens, we aim to address inclusive communication between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users. 
In this workshop, we will discuss and exchange methods, tools, and scenarios applicable for inclusive communication, identify the most relevant research gaps, and connect people for future collaborations.
