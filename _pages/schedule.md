## Before the Conference
Before the conference, participants will receive a welcoming message containing an introduction to the workshop. 

## At the Workshop
The workshop schedule is outlined in the sidebar table. We begin with a brief introduction from the event organizers (*Welcome*). Professor Wendy Ju will then give a talk about *Prototyping Methods*
and provide initial thoughts on design methods. Based on these and the proposed design methods of the workshop
papers, participants will engage in a discussion and use the methods hands-on. We will ask the participants to film how
they would interact with the prototype and van. The results will be displayed throughout the workshop to stimulate
discussions.

The main part of this workshop starts with session 1, *Introducing Methods* where the participants  introduce their prototyping method to each other. This will allow the participants to think of what prototyping method to use to design a van.
We will then randomly split participants into four to six groups (depending on attendance). 
After a break the participants will continue to discuss in their groups, based on the question *How would you prototype your Vanlife van based on the methods that were introduced in session 1?* The topics of the discussions can be changed to reflect better the interests of the participants and the submitted position papers. 

Topics: 
1. What are the different ways we can prototype a Vanlife van?
2. How do we enable the creation of novel prototyping methods?
3. How do people interact with each prototype?
4. How do designs differ when using different prototyping and design methods?

After presenting all the designs and videos, we will wrap up with a closing talk.
