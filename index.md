# WeCare - Workshop on Inclusive Communication between Automated Vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users

> Automated vehicles are expected to become a part of the road traffic in the near future. This upcoming change raises concerns on how human road users, e.g., cyclists or pedestrians, would interact with them to ensure safe communication on the road. Previous work focused primarily on the scenario in which a young adult without impairments crosses a street in front of an automated vehicle. Several road user groups, such as children, seniors, or people with special needs, in roles of pedestrians and cyclists, are not considered in this scenario. On top of this, cultural differences are rarely considered. To ensure that future traffic is safe and accessible for all citizens, we aim to address inclusive communication between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users. In this workshop, we will discuss and exchange methods, tools, and scenarios applicable for inclusive communication, identify the most relevant research gaps, and connect people for future collaborations.  

## Background
Social cues play an essential role in resolving road situations between car drivers and vulnerable road users (VRUs).
However, this interaction might be more challenging in the presence of automated vehicles (AVs) {% cite fagnant2015preparing %}. Previous works focused on addressing this issue using external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs, see \autoref{fig:ehmis})~\cite{colley2019including, LoeckenEHMIs} or by simulating social interactions via eye contact or gestures~\cite{rasouli2017understanding}. 
Such approaches primarily focus on visual stimuli (e.g., \cite{Hollander:2018:PDP:3282894.3282928, TT-Nguyen-2019-designing}) and do not comply with Universal Design principles (see \cite{connell1997principles}), which excludes people with visual limitations~\cite{colley2019including}. 
In general, several groups, such as children, blind people, or older adults, are underrepresented in empirical evaluations of eHMI concepts for interaction between AVs and VRUs. 
We aim to develop inclusive solutions with the help of this workshop to make the traffic accessible for them. 
Moreover, these groups are not limited to the example groups discussed below and may also include people with hearing loss, wheelchair users, or skateboarders. 


**Children** between six and thirteen are the most vulnerable subgroup among cyclists, due to the still-developing motor and perceptual-motor skills~\cite{aparicio2017advancing, ellis2014bicycle}.
Previous work tried to address the safety issue for child cyclists by augmenting bicycles and helmets to represent warnings~\cite{10.1145/3229434.3229479}, navigation~\cite{10.1145/3290605.3300850}, and lane-keeping cues~\cite{ 10.1145/3365610.3365632}.
Still, Deb et al.~\cite{deb2019comparison} identified children as underrepresented participants in studies with eHMIs. 
They revealed different behavior compared to the adult counterparts and identified a more risky behavior among children.
Thus, we find it particularly important to explore the design space for children as VRUs like cyclists or pedestrians.
