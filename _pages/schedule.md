Due to the measures against COVID-19, this workshop is going to be held in a virtual environment. 
Thus, the schedule below is outdated. 
We are trying to find good substitutes for the many interactive elements of this workshop. 
Please stay tuned for details.

{% include gallery caption="Examples for the interactive parts of the workshop: a *World Café* (left) and the result of a *quick prototype* (right)." %}

The schedule is now outdated. We are working on an alternative that can be realized with remote participation. Until then, this may still give you an idea of what we want to do in this workshop.

<!-- To this end, there are presentations, hands-on activities, and group discussions planned.  -->
We begin with a round of introduction, a brief presentation of the current state of research regarding automated vehicles and vulnerable road user interaction (Overview on eHMIs), and 4 minutes Pecha-Kucha style [[3](/References/#ref3)] presentations of the position papers by participants (Paper Presentations).

Between the first break and lunch, we want to establish a common understanding of the key challenges in current AV-VRU research. We will revise open questions from submitted workshop papers to derive topics for a World Café (see above Figure, left). Thus, groups of participants discuss a topic for twenty minutes before switching to another table. Possible subjects might be: “technology for AV-VRU communication including mobile devices”, “identification of cultural differences in traffic”, or “inclusive interfaces for impaired people”. After 60 minutes, each group presents the outcome of the table they are sitting at in about 15 minutes, including a 5 minutes discussion (Presentation). Afterward, the participants will be asked to write down their most important research challenges, and the workshop organizers will collect and cluster the presented findings (Research Challenges).

In the first 20 minutes after lunch, we will discuss identified challenges based on the World Café results (Discussion). 
Afterward, participants are split into groups of four people to prototype matching interaction techniques, methods, or scenarios, using the “Quick and Dirty Prototyping” technique (Prototyping, see above Figure, right). 
After 50 minutes, each group has 10 minutes to present their prototype(s) before the afternoon break (Presentations).

In the last part, we want to focus on the results of the workshop and the next steps (Results). The composed challenges and solutions are split into clusters and become revisited in groups for 15 minutes. Afterward, the relevance of each research opportunity / challenge is discussed in a plenum (Plenum Discussion). The goal is to reach a common understanding of research gaps and opportunities as well as requirements for inclusive AV-VRU interaction. The last 30 minutes are dedicated to wrapping up the workshop’s outcomes, plan the next steps, and discuss where to publish possible results (Wrap Up). Furthermore, we aim to agree on a platform for future exchanges of workshop participants, e.g., a Slack team.
