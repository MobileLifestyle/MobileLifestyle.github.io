The workshop focuses on inclusion, which relates not only to accessibility but also to cultural differences and diversity.
We invite researchers and practitioners from different cultures, backgrounds, and disciplines to explore inclusive
interaction between AVs and other road users. Their interests may involve inclusion or assistive devices for children,
seniors, or people with disabilities, but also vehicular user interfaces. 

Whether you're an interior design enthusiast, or seasoned van lifer, this workshop is the perfect platform to explore various prototyping methods and design the perfect interior of a van. Unleash your creativity, receive expert guidance, and connect with a community filled with interesting individuals. Participants who have any interest in van life and or design are welcome to join. 

## Registration
You have two options for participation: 
* Submit a position paper to present it (see below)
* Participate without presenting your position (no submissions needed). 


To register for the workshop please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBMCOIWrQfsISUA3Z47zBlSdPpfKoFzmL4TD-SioOGlIoBNw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Google Form.</a>

## Paper 
Participants are invited to submit position papers, but are not required to do so. 
Submissions **need not be anonymous**. However, reviews will be done anonymously. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two organizers of this workshop with regard to its contribution to the workshop. **All accepted submissions will be published online** on this website but not in the ACM Digital Library. 
The generated PDF should be submitted via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBMCOIWrQfsISUA3Z47zBlSdPpfKoFzmL4TD-SioOGlIoBNw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Google Form.</a>

### Paper Format 
A paper must be between two and four pages long, not including references, in the newest preview version of [ACM Conference Proceedings "Master" Template version 1.87](https://github.com/a3ws/acmart_workshoptemplate/releases/download/1.87-a3ws/template_1.87.zip). 
We use this version to facilitate adding a CC license to your paper. Your main .tex file should therefore start with the following code (see also template):
```
\documentclass[sigconf,pbalance]{acmart}
\usepackage[type={CC}, modifier={by-nc}, version={4.0}]{doclicense}
\settopmatter{printacmref=false, printccs=false}

\acmConference[AutomotiveUI~'23 Workshop -- Prototyping Mobile Lifestyles]{Prototyping Mobile Lifestyles in conjunction with AutomotiveUI~'23}{September 18, 2023}{Ingolstadt, Germany}
\copyrightyear{2023}
\acmYear{2023}
\acmBooktitle{Prototyping Mobile Lifestyles in conjunction with AutomotiveUI~'23}
\acmDOI{}
\acmISBN{}
\acmPrice{}
\setcopyright{cc}
\setcctype[4.0]{by-nc} % select your appropriate CC license
```
The CCS-concepts can be removed. 
The paper needs to be submitted as a PDF file and should resemble this example file: [Example_Paper.pdf]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ACM_Conference_Proceedings_Example.pdf).

<!-- ### Video Format
To submit a video, authors must create a PDF file containing their names, the title of the video, and the URL to the video file. 
The video must remain online until the decision deadline. 
Video formats should have a resolution of at least 1080p or 1080x1920 px. 
The audio bitrate should be at least 128 kbps for Mono, or 384 kbps for Stereo sound. 
Video contents are expected to contain captions for increased accessibility. 
Authors are free to structure their videos as they see fit, as long as they stay within three minutes. 
For example, a simple way to create a video could be to record a Pecha-Kucha style presentation [[3](/References/#ref3)]. 
Videos should not contain advertisements or be heavily promotional. 
The prepared PDF should be submitted via Easychair and resemble this example file: [Example_Video.pdf](../assets/Video_Example.pdf). -->

## Goals of the Workshop
We aim to explore both design and prototyping methods as well as designs for Vanlife as a surrogate for AVs. We intend
to achieve the following:
1. Explore different use cases of (automated) vehicles.
2. Raise awareness about possible research directions in the field of AVs.
3. Provide an overview and teach about interaction design.
4. Facilitate hands-on experience and live feedback in designing Vanlife and interaction methods.
5. Identify research barriers that explain why research on inclusive communication has not increased recently,
although this research gap is well known.
6. Create and deepen connections between interdisciplinary researchers for (international) cooperation.
7. Finding new prototyping methods for Vanlife.

### Workshop Themes
Potential topics to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited to: 
* Concept of creating a van fit for vanlife 
  * Life-style
  * What to include inside
  * Budget
* Prototyping and designing methods
  * Creating new methods
  * How complicated is it to use
  * Using and interacting with the prototyping methods
* Designs
  * Uniqueness of each design, based on the different prototyping and designing methods used
* Imagining potential use cases for future vehicles 



<!-- ## Tools Used at the Workshop
This workshop will be held remotely. It is important that participants test their tools and devices for a smooth event. 
Below, we list the currently planned tools that will be used during the workshop. 
If you see problems with these tools, feel free to contact us (see [Organizers](../Organizers) for contact details).  -->

### (Asynchronous) Communication
We plan to use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as communication platform for discussion before or after the workshop.  -->
