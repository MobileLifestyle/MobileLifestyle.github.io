<p> <span style="font-size: 1.5em">Workshop on Inclusive Communication between Automated Vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users </span><br/>
In conjunction with MobileHCI 2020, October 5th, Oldenburg, Germany.</p>

**Note:** Participants must submit a position paper before the workshop. See [Submission](#submission) for more details.

**Abstract:** Automated vehicles are expected to become a part of the road traffic in the near future. This upcoming change raises concerns on how human road users, e.g., cyclists or pedestrians, would interact with them to ensure safe communication on the road. 
Previous work focused primarily on the scenario in which a young adult without impairments crosses a street in front of an automated vehicle. Several road user groups, such as children, seniors, or people with special needs, in roles of pedestrians and cyclists, are not considered in this scenario. On top of this, cultural differences are rarely considered. To ensure that future traffic is safe and accessible for all citizens, we aim to address inclusive communication between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users. 
In this workshop, we will discuss and exchange methods, tools, and scenarios applicable for inclusive communication, identify the most relevant research gaps, and connect people for future collaborations.

## Goals of the Workshop
We intend to achieve the following goals with this workshop:
1.	Provide an overview of the current state of the research for interaction between AVs and VRUs.
2.	Identify the research gap and raise awareness for lowering the barriers to traffic participation.
3.	Hands-on experience and live feedback in designing inclusive interfaces.
4.	Establish communication with workshop attendees for future (international) collaborations.

## Audience
This workshop invites people from different cultures, backgrounds, and affiliations to explore the interplay of automated vehicles and other road users. 
The workshop emphasizes cultural differences, diversity, and inclusive design solutions for the interaction of AVs and VRUs. 
<!-- The organizers will be available throughout the sessions to support participants during the activities. An overview of the schedule is presented on the left sidebar.  -->
We welcome researchers and practitioners with interest in accessible technology, interactive technologies for children, seniors, or people with impairments, or automotive user interfaces. Specifically, we want to reach those developing mobile interfaces for traffic participants (e.g., pedestrians, or cyclists), inclusive interfaces (addressing, e.g., visually impaired people), or external human-machine interfaces for AVs. We will promote this workshop using a dedicated website with information about it. 
<!-- We will reach out to the community via social media channels (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn), mailing lists (e.g., GI, or ACM SIGCHI), and at the AutomotiveUI conference. We expect to have 15 to 20 attendees.  -->

## Submission 
Participants are required to submit position papers between two and four pages, not counting references, in the [2020 CHI Extended Abstract Format](https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF). 
The generated PDF should be submitted as e-mail to "wecare2020@<span style="display:none;">thisisnotpartofthedomain-</span>pm.<span style="display:none;">thisnoteither-</span>me". *Please contact us if you do not receive a confirmation e-mail within 24 hours*

Submissions **need not be anonymous**. However, reviews will be done anonymously. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two organizers of this workshop with regard to its contribution to the workshop. **All accepted papers will be published online** before the beginning of the workshop. 

### Workshop Themes
Potential topics to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited to: 
* Overview of the current state and research gaps in research on interactions between AVs and VRUs 
* Communication concepts for underrepresented user groups, such as
  * Children 
  * People with impaired vision
  * Older adults
* Guidelines for inclusive design from related domains, such as
  * Mobile Human-Computer Interaction
  * Human-Robot Interaction 

### Deadlines

## Workshop Organization
<!-- To this end, there are presentations, hands-on activities, and group discussions planned.  -->
We begin with a round of introduction, a brief presentation of the current state of research regarding automated vehicles and vulnerable road user interaction (Overview on eHMIs), and 4 minutes Pecha-Kucha style [3] presentations of the position papers by participants (Paper Presentations).

Between the first break and lunch, we want to establish a common understanding of the key challenges in current AV-VRU research. We will revise open questions from submitted workshop papers to derive topics for a World Café (see above Figure, left). Thus, groups of participants discuss a topic for twenty minutes before switching to another table. Possible subjects might be: “technology for AV-VRU communication including mobile devices”, “identification of cultural differences in traffic”, or “inclusive interfaces for impaired people”. After 60 minutes, each group presents the outcome of the table they are sitting at in about 15 minutes, including a 5 minutes discussion (Presentation). Afterward, the participants will be asked to write down their most important research challenges, and the workshop organizers will collect and cluster the presented findings (Research Challenges).

In the first 20 minutes after lunch, we will discuss identified challenges based on the World Café results (Discussion). 
Afterward, participants are split into groups of four people to prototype matching interaction techniques, methods, or scenarios, using the “Quick and Dirty Prototyping” technique (Prototyping, see above Figure, right). 
After 50 minutes, each group has 10 minutes to present their prototype(s) before the afternoon break (Presentations).

In the last part, we want to focus on the results of the workshop and the next steps (Results). The composed challenges and solutions are split into clusters and become revisited in groups for 15 minutes. Afterward, the relevance of each research opportunity / challenge is discussed in a plenum (Plenum Discussion). The goal is to reach a common understanding of research gaps and opportunities as well as requirements for inclusive AV-VRU interaction. The last 30 minutes are dedicated to wrapping up the workshop’s outcomes, plan the next steps, and discuss where to publish possible results (Wrap Up). Furthermore, we aim to agree on a platform for future exchanges of workshop participants, e.g., a Slack team.
